### Project Frameworks and Design Choices

This project uses _Vuejs_ in front and _Nodejs/Express_ in the backend <br>
with _MongoDB_ as NoSQL server.<br><br>
Starting with the backend, it was aimed to be as simple as possible, <br>
just to support the front-end needs, that's why it does the job of serving
the static file of the front-end as also running the **REST** API. <br>
The front-end uses _Vue_ and _Vuex_ as a way to keep all the important data
in one place. <br>
The model of front mimics the model of the back, that is an object holding
the current view type and a list of certifications.
```
const state = {
  type: '',
  certifications: []
}
```
For the styling the chosen framework is _ [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) _ because its lighter then the others frameworks
